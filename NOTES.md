# 1. Zero to "It Works!"

- I decided to not bother with a separate git repo / submodule for `best_quotes` for now. I will do it later if it starts to cause problems
- Maybe I will create a parent directory containing both `best_quotes` and `rulers`
- TIL that gem works with git to know which files to include in the spec - I suppose that might be the reason for having `best_quotes` in its own repo
- I keep needing to delete my version of the gem before rebuilding it, anyone else?
- Exercise two is referencing `Array#sum` instead of `deeply_empty?`
- I will come back and make some weird monkey patches when I have more time
